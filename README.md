#  Python Phone Book

A simple Python-based phone book application that allows you to **store, search, display, and delete contacts**.  
Contact data is saved in a **JSON file**, so it remains available even after the program is closed.

##  Features
-  **Add new contact** (name & number)
-  **Search contact** by name
-  **Display all contacts**
-  **Delete a contact**
-  **Data persistence** using JSON file

## How to Run

If it doesnâ€™t exist, the program will show error that file not found!
